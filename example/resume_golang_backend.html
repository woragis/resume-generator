          <ul>
            <li>
              Designed and implemented microservices in Go (gRPC + REST) for
              auth and billing; reduced average API latency by 35% through
              profiling and targeted optimizations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Led migration of a monolith to containerized services on GKE;
              improved deployment frequency and reduced incident recovery time
              by 50%.
